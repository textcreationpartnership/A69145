            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now in this deſire of preferring Antiquitie, al Catholicks moſt ioyfully wil ioyne hands with M.

And although the guard and ſtrength of Truth in this point of Antiquitie is euer ſuch, that she reſteth ſtil accompanyed, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and fortified with ſureſt friends, ſtrongeſt towers, and beſt munition, yet neuer may she repoſe in greater quiet, or more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly appeare with greater honour, then when her ſoueraigne right, titles, and prerogatiues are plainly admitted, granted, and acknowledged by the ſworne and profeſſed enemies of Truth. And yet, according to that of <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi>

               <hi>Truth is more forcible to wring out confeſsion, then anie rack or torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No wit of man can finde out Arguments more conuincing in themſelues the truth of Religion, then the plaine Texts and literal ſenſe of holie Writ, the infallible decrees of the Church and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councels, the vnanimous conſent of ancient Fathers and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and often the common light of Nature and Reaſon itſelf; yet <hi>ad hominem</hi> (as the Schoole-men terme it) and for the final pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of al further Plea, shifts, and euaſions in the Aduerſarie, no courſe more ſpeedie, no victorie more certain, no obiection more vnanſwerable, then the plaine, ſimple, and ſincere confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Aduerſarie himſelf.</p>
            <p>In Ciuil and temporal differences concerning lands and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb facs="tcp:250:5"/> very forcible and hopeful are the Arguments drawne from the ancient and authentical Euidences, from lawful and vninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Preſcription, from the plaine and literal word and ſenſe of the Law, from the ſwarming conſent of Iudges and Councel learned, and from ſufficient teſtimonie of moſt credible aad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued witneſſes; yet not one, no nor al of theſe ioyntly concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, are anie thing ſo potent for the ſpeedieſt and ſureſt deciſion of the Cauſe, as the free acknowledgement and aſſent of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, only enforced through the rack of clear and vndenyable Truth.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Moyſes</hi> hauing ſundrie wayes proued the Goodnes and Power of God Almightie aboue the Gods of the Gentils, vrgeth as the ſtrongeſt argument, that the Gentils his<note n="[33)" place="margin">

For who would not thinke, but that anie man of iudgement and learning diligently peruſing the large and learned Works but only of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Iodocus Coccius,</hi> men ſo ſtudious, payneful, and ſincere in deſcribing the pedigree of the Church of Chriſt, but that he would eaſily ſee, iudge, and confeſſe the ancient primitiue Church, Faith, and Religion, the moſt approued General Councels, and learnedſt Doctours, the moſt authentical Records, Hiſtories, and Monuments of thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt times, al of them to teſtifye, to depoſe, and confirme the ſelf-ſame Truth, Faith, and Religion, which the preſent Roman Church at this day beleeueth, practiſeth, and profeſſeth? And yet what a world of tricks, fallacies, and inuentions hath the Enemie ſuggeſted to our moderne Hereticks, for the blemishing and obſcuring of that cleareſt glaſſe of the Primitiue Church, wherin our preſent Roman is ſo liuely repreſented? Who would thinke it equal to oppoſe a dark and caſual ſaying of <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> (for example) againſt his knowne practiſe and laboured proof to the contrarie? And who would not blush to oppoſe <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> (to his fowleſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace) as contrarie to himſelf? What more deſperate courſe can be taken, then to cenſure his moſt certain writings for counterfet, becauſe they contradict and confute their impious Nouelties? What greater ſchiſme can be raiſed againſt the Church, then to pretend her chiefeſt Bishops, Doctours, and Paſtours in the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt articles of Faith to be at mutual and deadlie warres amongſt themſelues? What more audacious temeritie and baſe ingratitude can Malice itſelf offer to thoſe our ſo noble Progenitours, then to alter and corrupt their learnedſt writings, which as cleareſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for the Catholick Faith they bequeathed to Poſteritie? And yet theſe and manie more then theſe are the ordinarie Sophiſmes of our late Sectaries. For the ſureſt and final preuention of al which, what shorter or more expedite courſe can I take, then
<pb facs="tcp:250:6"/> (Proteſtants for example appealing to the Primitiue Church, and her Doctours and Paſtours) to produce themſelues confeſſing al theſe to be their Enemies, and the Teachers and Patrons of Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie?

Wherof I reſt alſo very confident, in that the method generally obſerued therin, by concluding my intent from the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my Aduerſaries, is the courſe ſpecially affected and ſtudyed by yourſelf in al your writings, which cannot but beget ſome better liking in your ſetled iudgement therof.</p>
            <p>But that indeed, Sir, which did chiefly induce me aboue the reſt both to compile and dedicate this Work, as you ſee, was your <hi>Appeale for Proteſtants</hi> made in anſwer to the <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Apologie for the Roman Church.</hi> For hauing diligently peruſed and examined this our Apologie, and finding the Arguments there framed to be moſt concluding, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies produced to be moſt pertinent, and al this euer to be backed
<pb facs="tcp:250:7"/> and ſtrengthned with the anſwerable acknowledgements of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants themſelues, I muſt confeſſe, my thirſting curioſitie was ſuch, as that neither my thoughts nor deſires were at reſt, vntil with like dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I had peruſed and examined your <hi>Proteſtants Appeale.</hi> Which finding to be ſuch, as I wil ſhortly deſcribe, I was he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce encouraged, to make yet further vſe of the foreſayd <hi>Apologie,</hi> conioyning therewith ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of my owne in that kind; which as I deſire they may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to al, ſo to yourſelf moſt earneſtly I wiſh.</p>
            <p>And ſo now briefly to diſcouer to yourſelf and al other iudicious Readers the manner of your anſwer vſed throughout your whole <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, M. Brierlie,</hi> a Catholick Roman Prieſt, preſuming to preſent vnto his Maieſtie of <hi>Great Britanie</hi> our Soueraigne Lord King <hi>Iames,</hi> his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Petition</hi> in behalf of the Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> ſo grieuouſly preſſed and perſecuted, during the Raigne of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his late Predeceſſour, amongſt innumerable Motiues, which as ſo manie darts would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently wound a hart ſo ſenſible of his Subiects miſeries, iniuries, and oppreſſions, he ſpecially ſelected the ſweeteſt harmonie and moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing concord in matters Diuine and Celeſtial, between the Ancient, Apoſtolick, and Catholick Faith of the Primitiue Church of Chriſt, and our preſent Roman; nothing doubting, but that the bare preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the louelie face of ſo gray Antiquitie would timely beget in ſo generous and noble a Mind an immouable loue and liking to al her true heires and lawful poſteritie.</p>
            <p>But M. Brierlie further knowing the malignant Enemie his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie impoſture, in ſending forth <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> for the dazeling and deluding of the beſt aſpects, in preuention therof and al other imaginable deceit in that kind, the ſelf-ſame <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> his greateſt enemies, he ſpecially picked for his chiefeſt Aduocats; ſtrangely, but indeed moſt ſtrongly affecting the equitie of his Cauſe to be finally decided by no other Iudge then the Aduerſarie therof. For wheras the indubitate writings of the ancienteſt Fathers, the ſacred Decrees of al General Councels, the credible Hiſtories of al times and places, the ſureſt records of al Lawes and Countries, yea al monuments of greateſt Antiquitie doe ioyntly conteſt and depoſe, not only for the vniuerſal and vninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted continuance of our Roman Faith from Chriſt's verie time vntil the Date heerof, but alſo for the ſympathie or rather Identitie of our ſame Faith with the Faith of the Apoſtles and their firſt Diſciples: M. <hi>Brierlie</hi> often obſeruing al theſe our honours and helps to haue been ſo ſtrangely defaced, blemished, and obſcured by the art and malice of the foreſayd <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> as that their true face and beautie were neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to be ſeen or knowne to vulgar Proteſtants, purpoſely therefore forbare, to preſente Antiquitie only in her natiue colours, and chiefly to reſt contented with that ſtayned dye and luſter, which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant pencil, through her cleareſt ſplendour, durſt not denye her; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to that end the plentiful and cleareſt teſtimonies of almoſt al the primeſt Writers, that euer Proteſtancie brought forth, al of them
<pb facs="tcp:250:8"/> as it were conſpiring in flat charging, reprouing, and impugning the learnedſt Doctours and moſt renowned Bishops of the eldeſt and pureſt times for the ſelf-ſame doctrines and practiſe of Religion, which the Roman Church at this day exerciſeth.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſing <hi>M. Brierlie</hi> his ſincere and faithful demeanour heerin, what could the wit of man produce more palpable and concluding for our foreſayd harmonie with the Primitiue Church? For if the volumes of Fathers and Councels be ſo clear in themſelues for our Catholick, Roman, and Papiſtical Faith, that the learnedſt Proteſtans moſt playnly ſtudying and peruſing the ſame, are finally enforced through euidence of their words and deeds to acknowledge and reproue the ſelf-ſame Doctours and Bishops for Roman Catholicks, then <hi>M. Brierlie</hi> his deſire and intent of prouing our Roman Faith and Church to continue moſt agreable with the Primitiue Faith and Church of Chriſt and his Apoſtles is fully accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>M. Brierlie</hi> his candour may more clearly ſhine, and his ſo vnanſwerable Arguments be the better conceaued, I wil therefore diſpel thoſe thick clowdes, wherewith yourſelf <hi>(M. Morton)</hi> hath moſt painefully laboured to couer or darken the foreſayd brightnes. What then muſt we expect from you for an Anſwer pertinent, and direct, and as proceeding from a iudicious and learned Doctour, yea from a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ſimple truth,</hi> but either ingenuouſly to confeſſe with the Puritans and ſo manie your other Proteſtant Brethren cited by <hi>M. Brierlie,</hi> that the ſayd Primitiue and pureſt Church of Chriſt was one and the ſame for Faith and Religion with our now Roman: or elſe that <hi>M. Brierlie</hi> had cunningly corrupted, maymed, and defaced the ſayings and writings of your foreſayd Brethren in his owne behalf. If you ſeing the firſt to be moſt true would haue honeſtly ſubſcribed therunto, as manie more learned Proteſtants then yourſelf had formerly done, then your Anſwer or <hi>Appeale</hi> had been altogeather needles. The ſecond you durſt not auouch, knowing right wel, that <hi>M. Brierlie</hi> his affected nicenes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſenes in ſo particularly quoting his Aduerſaries Bookes, Chapters, Pages, lines or letters would ouer ſtrongly conteſt for his Religious integritie, induſtrie, and fidelitie in handling the ſame.</p>
            <p>What then is imaginable for you <hi>(M. Doctour)</hi> to anſwer againſt ſuch pregnant teſtimonies of other Proteſtant Doctours? Nothing at al, but what <hi>M. Brierlie</hi> foreſaw, and accordingly premoniſhed (and wherof yourſelf alſo taketh notice in the beginning of your <hi>Appeale</hi>) would be only trifeling, vnworthie, extrauagant, and impertinent.</p>
            <p>As firſt, when your other Brethren are plentifully produced confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and reprouing the Fathers for teaching our Roman Faith, yourſelf often very honeſtly ioyne with them, acknowledging the ſame in our behalf, and againſt yourſelf; ſo that in this Caſe in ſteed of Anſwer or <hi>Appeale</hi> you make a ſtrong Apologie for <hi>M.

            <p>But to leaue this your ſo plaine dealing, and to come to ſome of your more ſlipperie tricks: wheras M.

            <p>At other times you admit, that the Proteſtant Writers alleadged by M. <hi>Brierlie</hi> did indeed reproue the Fathers for ſeueral points of Papiſtrie; but therewith you are diſpleaſed, and oppoſe yourſelf againſt your owne deare Brethren, charging them to haue done the ſame without iuſt cauſe, and with greateſt wrong and iniurie to the ſaid Fathers.

And what man of ordinarie ſenſe and reaſon wil not giue more credit to manie of the primeſt Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, inhabiting ſeueral nations, through euidence of truth, thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and confeſſing againſt themſelues, and in behalf of Catholicks, then to you, M. <hi>Morton,</hi> through want of good conſcience or ſolid iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, impugning the truth and your more ancient and learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants?</p>
            <p>Againe, you being vnable directly &amp; punctually to anſwer the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid teſtimonies of your Brethren acknowledging and reprouing the Fathers for teaching our Catholick Faith, you thinke to bleare the eye
<pb facs="tcp:250:10"/> of an ignorant Reader, by obiecting ſundrie ſayings of the ſayd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as making againſt thoſe ſeueral points of Fayth, for which they were formerly confeſſed by other Proteſtants; and this is an ordinarie ſhift throughout your whole Booke. But yet this doth leſſe ſatisfye then al the reſt; for firſt if the other Proteſtants peruſing the Fathers writings, no doubt with as great diligence as yourſelf hath done, had found ſuch pregnant places in behalf of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, as you now pretend, they would neuer haue written and diuulged the direct contrarie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the vtter ruine of their Cauſe and the eternal ſhame of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. Beſides, ſundrie Proteſtants citing ſeueral Texts of the Fathers as making for Papiſtrie, and you heer alleadging ſeueral others as impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame and making for Proteſtancie, what ſhould this inferre, but that the Doctours &amp; Biſhops euen of the Primitiue Church ſhould make mutual contradiction and warres amongſt themſelues in the chiefeſt articles of our Chriſtian Faith and Religion? yea, which is more abſurd, it would further conclude one and the ſame Father, <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> (for Example) to be contrarie to himſelf; for as you do heer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten alleadge him in proof of ſeueral particulars of your new Reformed Faith, ſo do manie Proteſtants produce him as impugning the ſayd particulars. Now what more groſſe abſurditie can be vttered, then that <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> not in one but in manie points of Faith ſhould thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf? Laſtly ſuch ſayings of Fathers as you heer produce in behalf of yourſelf, are but the knowne obiections made and anſwered by Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and other Catholick Writers.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Brierlie</hi> affecting through his whole Booke to confirme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince his wiſhed intent by the cleareſt teſtimonies of his Proteſtant Aduerſaries, you wil needs follow the ſame courſe, producing in that behalf the plentiful ſayings of our Catholick Writers; but with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference, your Conſcience wel knew. For firſt M. <hi>Brierlie</hi> allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſuch Proteſtants as for learning and iudgement were moſt renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reſpected through the whole Proteſtant Church; ſuch were <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Oecolampadius, Zuinglius, Chemnitius,</hi> the <hi>Centuriſts, Caluin, Beza, Whitguift, Bale, Whitaker, Iewel, Humfrie, Reynolds, Parkins</hi> and ſundrie ſuch others. Secondly, theſe Proteſtants he produceth as confeſſing the Fathers to agree with vs Catholicks, not only in matters of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, indifferencie, or ſuch as are not yet determined by the Church or General Councel, but euen in the chiefeſt and moſt important Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Concluſions of Faith, controuerted at this day between Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks and Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Now as for the Catholick Writers alledged by you, <hi>M. Morton,</hi> a great part of them are ſuch as for their knowne errours haue their writings already cenſured and condemned by their Mother-Church; ſuch were <hi>Eraſmus, Valla, Caſſander, Nilus, Agrippa</hi> and ſuch like; and from theſe only doe you fetch ſuch teſtimonies as concerne matter of ſome moment; for as for other approued Catholick Writers, as <hi>S. Thomas, S. Bonauenture, Lombard, Scotus, Bellarmine, Sanders, Allen, Parſons,</hi> and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<pb facs="tcp:250:10"/> others, though you cite them often, yet neuer as denying anie one Article or Concluſion of Faith, defined at anie time by the Church of Chriſt, but only as diſſenting amongſt themſelues in matters diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and indifferent; nor euer as confeſſing the Fathers of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church to make for Proteſtants in matters of Faith, as now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted between them and Catholicks.</p>
            <p>And as for the teſtimonies gathered from the former and worſer rank of Catholicks, they can nothing preiudice our Catholick Cauſe. For firſt, as before, their errours and bookes are cenſured, condemned, and prohibited by that verie Church, wherin they were Baptized or firſt became Chriſtians, to wit, the Roman. Secondly, moſt of the ſayd Authours finally recanted their errours, ſubmitting themſelues and their writings to the Cenſure of the Catholick Church. And laſtly, as it may not be denyed, but that in the State Politick the Prince with his Councel may iuſtly puniſh, cenſure, and correct ſuch men with their errours, as ſhal ſeeke to innouate in anie thing againſt the former receaued and eſtabliſhed lawes of the whole kingdome; ſo much more is the like iuſtifyable, expedient, and neceſſarie in the Spiritual gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I might heer proceed to ſundrie other ſuch like euaſions of yours; but I feare to exceed the ordinarie bounds, and therefore wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, aſſuring the iudicious and impartial Reader, who ſhal diligently peruſe your ſwelling and ample <hi>Appeale</hi> written in anſwer to a ſmal part of <hi>M. Brierlie</hi> his firſt and leaſt <hi>Apologie,</hi> that certainly he may expect in lieu of a <hi>Due and ſatisfyable Anſwer,</hi> firſt, that yourſelf is often enforced to confeſſe with <hi>M. Brierlie</hi> and againſt yourſelf, that the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in ſeueral important points of Religion were Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks. Secondly, that manie of the ſtrongeſt allegations brought by <hi>M. Brierlie</hi> are not ſo much as named, and much leſſe anſwered by your <hi>dumb Spirit.</hi> Thirdly, that you are often compelled to impugne and diſgrace your owne Proteſtant Brethren, vtterly denying and diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in that, which they through the Sunne-ſhine and ſplendour of truth haue plentifully acknowledged, though againſt themſelues, you ſo <hi>Appealing</hi> from them no leſſe then from <hi>M. Brierlie</hi> himſelf. Fourthly, that finding yourſelf not able to euade ſuch conuincing proofes taken only from Proteſtant Doctours by anie direct and pertinent Anſwer, you fil vp your paper with ſuch Sayings of Fathers, as are either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by yourſelf, or frequently alreadie anſwered by Catholick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; which is no other anſwer neither, but that Proteſtants amongſt themſelues do alledge the Fathers, yea one and the ſelf-ſame Father as fighting with himſelf; the affirming wherof is as groſſe an abſurditie, as my ſelf would deſire my greateſt Aduerſarie to be plunged in. And laſtly, that for ſuch teſtimonies as you draw from Catholick Writers, they are either ſuch, as are already condemned by the Catholick Church, or els are not concerning anie Article or Concluſion of Faith, but only matters indifferent and diſputable in Schooles.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:250:24"/> that as ſhe was founded by the Apoſtles, ſo ſhe continued in the doctrine of the Apoſtles, euen vntil the verie times of S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who flouriſhed almoſt 100. yeares after <hi>Conſtantin;</hi> in ſo much as during al the ſayd time, the verie Succeſſion of Roman Biſhops, is granted by Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, to haue been a good proof of the true Faith.</p>

Secondly, the firſt whitnes of haires, or the firſt decay in health, or building, cannot at the firſt he diſcerned, though they were moſt preciſely regarded, which is euidently otherwiſe in change of Doctrine, and practiſe thereof. Thirdly, none are ſpecially appointed, neither is there anye ſuch vrging neceſſitie to marke the firſt change of the haires, and the like; whereas it is the ſpecial charge, and command, not of few, but of al the Churches Paſtours, not only to obſerue, but alſo publickly to withſtand the other, with the vttermoſt of their power and learning.</p>
               <p>But admitting for the time, that the foreſaid ſimilitudes were pertinent, and that we were not to vrge Proteſtants to shew the firſt begining of our ſo great a change, as is by them imagined; Yet we are in al reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that as, though the firſt white haire, or ſlifter, or degree of diſeaſe, be not diſcerned, yet the further degrees and encreaſe of them being moſt markable &amp; to be ſeen, that therefore they are to diſcouer, &amp; deſcribe to vs, ſome ſenſible proceedings, &amp; encreaſe of this our ſuppoſed change. And if they wil ſay, it was not made al at once, but by litle, &amp; litle, ſometimes in on point of Faith, ſometimes in an other, then ſtil muſt we vrge them to shew thoſe ſeueral litle changes, as what points of doctrine were ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees changed? Who were the Authours of the change? What Popes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun or firſt allowed them? by what Doctours; and Paſtours were they firſt contradicted? Or els, they in al theſe being moſt ſilent, we may moſt ſtrongly conclude, that our Roman Church, being thus free from al knowne change or Innouation, ſince the Apoſtles times, that therefore she is not anie Heretical ſect, <hi>Going out</hi> or departing from a former Church, nor her doctrine Heretical, no one Article thereof being lyable to that fouleſt ſtayne of Innouation.</p>
               <p>Whereas to the contrarie, the verie firſt beginings, changes, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſies, made by <hi>Waldo, Wicclif, Huſſe, Luther, Suinglius, Caluin,</hi> or anie other pretended Proteſtant, in anie Age whatſoeuer, were euer ſo obſerued, contradicted, and condemned by the watchful Paſtours of the Roman Church, as that euerie particular, both of Perſon, time, place, and opinion, are euerie where to be ſeene in ſundrie Writers, both Catholick and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant.</p>
               <p>But to reach <hi>M. D. Morton</hi> yet an other ſcantling of an Heretick, we muſt obſerue, that this name <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> giuen at firſt to al beleeuers, was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially taken to diſtinguish them from the Iewes and Gentils, which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not at al in Chriſt.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:250:90"/> the name <hi>Chriſtian</hi> was too general to ſeuer Hereticks from true beleeuers. And therefore the Apoſtles impoſed the name <hi>Catholick</hi> vpon al ſuch as in al points were obedient to the Churches Doctrine. Hereof ſaith expreſly <hi>M. Wotton</hi>

               </p>

               <p>Wherefore ſeing manie Articles of our Catholick Faith, in the opinion of Proteſtants, are moſt grieuous errors, and yet they not able to ſhew when anie one of them firſt came in with Contradiction, but in al want thereof, are inforced to betake themſelues to the obſcure Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of other opinions neuer taught, but impugned by the Roman Church, neither euer generally diuulged, but abortiue and periſhed in their firſt Birth, moſt of them alſo ariſing in the Churches begining, when by reaſon of the general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions then raging, and the want of printing, few monuments of thoſe times are now remaining; and yet al this notwithſtanding, their begining with Contradiction, is now to vs knowne and teſtifyed.

               </p>
               <p>Now to paſſe from the Time, to the Perſons, which <hi>D. White</hi> nameth

                  </note> 
                  <hi>one part of them is the Greek Church; an other part is ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Diuines of their owne Church; a third part is ſuch as the Roman Church perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. The firſt</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>are ſound and lawful witneſſes, being the true Church of God to this day, though polluted with ſome errours. The ſecond, though Papiſts in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie points, yet shew againſt al exception thoſe points, wherein they were no Papiſts, to haue been no part of the Catholick Faith, ſo called in their time; for then they would not haue reſiſted them, but embrace them as they do al the reſt. The third part I graunt the Church of Rome then perſecuted, and now calleth Hereticks (to wit, vs</hi> Proteſtants) <hi>but that is the queſtion &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now to examine the force of the argument, thus taken from this triple teſtimonie produced by our Doctour: Firſt I do conſtantly auerre that no one part of the three, no nor anie one man of that one part can be aſſigned which was not originally at his firſt birth and breeding, a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick, and not Proteſtant: And therefore though <hi>Going out</hi> of the Roman Church, he afterwardes contradicted the ſame in ſome one reſpect or other, yet this nothing proueth that the Roman Church did change her Faith but only that the ſayd ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo <hi>Going out</hi> from her, did change his Faith which she had formerly taught him, &amp; he beleeued. Secondly I do as reſolutely auouch, that not anie one man of al thoſe which <hi>D. White</hi> produceth, as obſeruers &amp; impugners of the pretended change of Roman Church, was not only at the firſt, but neuer after through his whole life truly P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore if their teſtimonie be good againſt vs in regard of ſome one or other opinion, wherein they haue Apoſtated from vs, agreing yet in the reſt; how much more forcible wil it be againſt Proteſtants, from whom they wholy diſclaime in moſt, and moſt important Articles of Faith?</p>
               <p>For example, the firſt part of <hi>D.

               <p>And laſtly how could the Doctour afford the Greek Church, ſo high a Title of <hi>being the true Church of God to this day,</hi> ſeing that it accordeth much more with the Roman, then the Proteſtant Church, and yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth from both?

Whites</hi> witneſſes produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt vs, and in behalf of himſelf; that is, to thoſe whom (ſayth he) <hi>the Church of Rome then perſecuted, and now calleth Hereticks,</hi> that is, Proteſtants; which in his Catalogue he nameth to be <hi>Berengarius, Bertram, Ahnaricus, the Waldenſes, Wiccliniſts, Lollards and Huſsites;</hi> al which he coupleth togeather like <hi>Sampſons foxes,</hi> to make them good witneſſes againſt the Roman Church. But firſt in what Court or Tribunal wil anie mans naked teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie be auailable againſt his Aduerſarie, and eſpecially of a conuicted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:250:95"/> offender againſt his Iudge, when he ſpeaketh only for his owne priuate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who may not diſclaime and reiect as ſuſpected, anie mans bare word in his own cauſe? This is the caſe of our laſt witneſſes, who going out and departing from our Roman Church, as al other Hereticks haue euer done, were alwaies noted, contradicted, and condemned for the ſame: What then can the force of their teſtimonie be againſt vs, but as of a Felon or Traytour againſt his lawful Iudge or Prince, hauing denounced ſentence of death againſt him.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I wil make it manifeſt that theſe who are produced as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants reſiſting the Roman Church in al Ages, were not Proteſtants, but cleerly diſſenting from them in manie fundamental points. And laſtly I would gladly know how poſſibly <hi>D. White</hi> could haue ſo good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Proteſtants reſiſting in al thoſe ſeueral Ages our Roman Church, when as I haue largely conuinced<note n="(27)" place="margin">

               <p>Wherefore after good examining, I doubt not but my Doctours Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants reſiſting in al Ages our Roman Church, wil finally reſolue into his owne idle fancies; which if they were as forcible to proue, as his fond imagination is fertil to frame them, the ruine of Catholicks were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable, and their verie memorie hateful.</p>
               <p>But to leaue now a while theſe ſo ſound and lawful witneſſes, and to come to the poynts wherin they made reſiſtance, I wil only obſerue that ſundrie of the poynts inſtanced by <hi>D. White,</hi> are either matters of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie, or not of Faith, neuer yet determined by the Church of God; or els of fact, and not of right, or laſtly only of life and conuerſation; al which is moſt impertinent in proof of anie change in Faith and Religion; which is the only point here to be proued by our Doctour.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now to graple neerer with our Catalogue-Maker, and to examine the points inſtanced in euerie Semicenturie for the Roman Churches change: <hi>After</hi> 600. <hi>yeares were expired</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſeueral poynts of true Faith began one after another to be more groſſely corrupted, and changed by the Church of Rome. In the firſt fiftie, I name Serenus Bishop of Marſeils in France, who brake the Images that began to be ſet vp in his Dioceſſe.</hi> But at the verie firſt <hi>M.

Gregorie</hi> himſelf, writing thus vnto him: <hi>Pictures are vſed in Churches that thoſe who are vnlearned, at leaſt should read by ſeing in the walles thoſe things which they could not read in bookes.

               </p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>D.

               <p>But <hi>D. White</hi> further vrgeth, that the ſayd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, the Centuriſts in the ſame place teach, that the 2. <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod was confirmed by Pope <hi>Adrian;</hi> but the Councel of <hi>Franckford</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth only ſuch Synods as are aſſembled without the Popes Authoritie; wherefore according to the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> not the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> wherein Images were approued, but ſome other was reproued by the Councel of <hi>Franckford.</hi> Thirdly, The <hi>Centuriſts</hi> further confeſſe, that the Councel of <hi>Franckford</hi> did not decree, that Images should be taken out of the Churches, but remayning in the Churches, that they should not be adored. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then do Proteſtants pul down Images, and break them? Wherefore do not themſelues obſerue the Decree of the Councel? Yea this verie Councel thundreth Anathema<note n="55)" place="margin">l. Carol. Hincmarus &amp; Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</note> to al ſuch as deface, break, &amp; pul down Images; how then wil our Proteſtants eſcape this bolt?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Councel of <hi>Franckford</hi> did indeed impugne<note n="56)" place="margin">l. Carol. &amp; Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus.</note> two Councels, one of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which decreed againſt Images, and the other of <hi>Nice</hi> which was for Images. But the impugning of this latter was only through errour and materially, euen as the Councel of <hi>Ariminum</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the word <hi>Homouſios;</hi> for the Authour of the Bookes vnder the name of <hi>Charles,</hi> had obtruded vnto the ſame Councel of <hi>Franckford</hi> two vntruths;<note n="57)" place="margin">In praef. lib.

Carol.</note> The ſecond, that this decree was made by the <hi>Grecians</hi> without the conſent of the Bishop of Rome. Now theſe two lyes ſuppoſed for truths, it is no wonder, though the Councel of <hi>Franckford</hi> reſiſted the Councel of <hi>Nice.</hi> And that theſe were mere Impoſtures falſly impoſed vpon the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> it is euident, aſwel in that the Legates of the Roman Bishop ſubſcribed to euerie Act, as alſo in that the Epiſtles of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> himſelf for Images,<note n="59)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</note> were read in the Councel it ſelf. And ſo likewiſe that the ſayd Councel did not decree Images, to be worshiped with <hi>Latria,</hi> is further manifeſt, in that <hi>Baſil of Ancyra,</hi> who was formerly an Heretick, being now conuerted and profeſſing the Catholick Faith, the<note n="(60)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 1.</note> whole Councel hearing him and approuing him, affirmed that he did <hi>worship Images, but not with Latria,</hi> ſeing that was due only to God: And the like
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:250:97"/>
                  <note n="(61)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act</hi> 3.4.7.</note> was profeſſed by <hi>Conſtantin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and other Bishops in the Seauenth Synode.</p>
               <p>Neither let it ſeeme improbable, that ſuch vntruths could be forged againſt a general Councel ſo lately before celebrated: Wheras moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants dare now affirme, that Catholicks adore Images as Gods, whereas almoſt thouſands of Catholick Writers and the General Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> celebrated in the Confins of <hi>Germanie,</hi> do declaime the contrarie; what wonder then if the like be forged of a Greek Synod, which few could read and vnderſtand, and which was celebrated in the Oriental parts, being far diſtant?</p>
               <p>Laſtly it is to be remembred, that though this Councel of <hi>Franckford</hi> did erre, yet was it not in matter of Faith, but only in fact, condemning vpon falſe information the Councel of <hi>Nice;</hi> neither was it euer confirmed, but expreſſely reiected by the Bishop of Rome; and therefore the errour thereof doth nothing preiudice the infallible authoritie of lawful approued General Councels. So manie wayes doth it appeare, that this thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne Argument from the Councel of <hi>Franckford</hi> againſt Images, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather impertinent.</p>
               <p>And now to come to the baſtard Booke fathered vpon <hi>Charles</hi> the Great: Firſt, the Booke of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Firſt to <hi>Charles</hi> is extant, whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the ſayd Booke was written by ſome Heretick, and ſent from <hi>Charles</hi> to <hi>Adrian,</hi> that he might anſwer it.

                  <hi>There is extant a refuting Booke, vnder the name of Charles the Great, which by the words thereof we may gather to haue bene made at the ſame time.</hi> Seauently, wheras <hi>Charles</hi> was knowne to be verie skilful both in

               <p>Eightly, ſuppoſing for the time, againſt al the premiſſes, that it had been <hi>Charles</hi> his Booke, yet nothing would it auaile, but much preiudice Proteſtants; for therein is expreſſely taught, that the laſt ſentence in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies of Faith belongeth to the Roman Biſhop: And that he hath his Primacie not from Councels, but from God himſelf. It preſcribeth alſo Exorciſmes to be vſed in Baptiſme, Churches to be dedicated with ſpecial Rites: That we are to pray for the dead, and Inuocate Saincts, and their Relicks to be worshipped: That Chriſme and Holie-water are to be vſed: That in the Euchariſt there is the true Bodie of Chriſt, and the ſame to be worshipped, yea to be offred as a true and proper Sacrifice: Al which do mainely impugne Proteſtant Religion: And therefore if they wil haue vs to beleeue this Booke, teaching that the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> erred concerning Images; let them beleeue it teaching the other Catholick poynts next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if it could be proued that <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf had made this Book, &amp; that he had been a perfect Proteſtant in al poynts; yet how would it hence follow, that the Roman Church had changed her Faith in the time of <hi>Charles?</hi> Or what would the teſtimonie of a Lay-man auaile them, ſeing according to<note n="69)" place="margin">Orat. <hi>2.</hi> de Imag.</note> Damaſcen, <hi>Chriſt committed not his Church to Kings and Emperours, but to Bishops and Paſtours?</hi> But we haue ſeene ſufficiently before, that <hi>Charles</hi> was a Prince wholy deuoted to the Roman Church, and a ſpecial Patron of Images, and conſequently the Booke written againſt them, and impoſed vpon him, is meerly forged and of no authoritie.</p>

                  <hi>to</hi> 850. <hi>I name</hi> (ſayth our Cataloguer) <hi>Ioannes Scotus, &amp;c. who reſiſting the Real preſence &amp;c. was therefore murdred: The ſame time Berthram alſo writ againſt it &amp;c. Claudius Bishop of Towres reſiſted Images, worship of Saincts, and Pilgrimage; Lotharius the Emperour reduced the Pope to the obedience of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the examples of the Roman Change in this time: But let vs examine them.</p>
               <p>As concerning <hi>Scotus,</hi> that he reſiſted the Real preſence, <hi>M. White</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it only by the teſtimonie of <hi>Daneus,</hi> who being a formal Proteſtant of

But yet I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that about the ſame time there was one <hi>Scotus</hi> (not the ſubtil Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour who liued ſome Ages after) but an other who writ ſomething doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in this poynt, but his Booke was condemned in the Councel at <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella,</hi> as teſtifyeth <hi>Lantfrancus:</hi>

Thirdly, <hi>Illiricus</hi> making a Catalogue of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant witneſſes (to whom our Miniſter, for this of his, is no litle beholding) doth yet forebeare altogeather to name him therein, but it ſeemes our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ment to make al good flesh, that he caſt into the pot. Fourthly, <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> was a Monke, and ſo continued vntil his dying day, not teaching anie one point of Proteſtancie in his life, as may appeare by<note n="(m)" place="margin">verbo Bertramus.

                  <hi>Tritemius</hi> and others that writ of him. Fiftly, ſuppoſing for the time that <hi>Scotus</hi> &amp; <hi>Bertram</hi> did both of them beleeue and write directly contrarie to the Real Preſence, yet what doth this proue, that the Roman Church as then did change her Faith, or make anie Innouation concerning this poynt? But rather that theſe two diſſenting then in this from the whole Chriſtian world, did change, and begin themſelues this their ſo ſingular and preſently condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned opinion. Sixtly, the Roman Church is ſo free in this Age from chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her Faith concerning the Real Preſence, that the verie Doctrine thereof is formerly<note n="73)" place="margin">

               <p>And as for <hi>Claudius Taurinenſis</hi> in this Age reſiſting images, it is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as alſo that he<note n="74)" place="margin">Ionas Aureol. de Cultu Imag.

Neither did <hi>Claudius</hi> reſiſt anie pretended begining, or change in the Roman Church; but only caſt out of the Churches of his Dioceſſe Images and Croſſes, which peraduenture were there erected long before <hi>Claudius</hi> was borne: But I need not inſiſt anie longer herein, this poynt being fully cleered in the example of <hi>Serenus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as for <hi>Lotharius</hi> the Emperour reducing Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Empire: Firſt, this concerneth only gouernment &amp; Policie, not Faith and Religion, which <hi>M.

               <p>Fourthly, our Catholick Writers, in euerie Age, haue plentifully recited, and at large co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed al appearing doctrines contrarie to the Roman Church, &amp; yet as for anie Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Religion knowne before <hi>Luther,</hi> they are wholy ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>

But al in vaine; for who euer more duly reuerenced, or more carefully preſerued thoſe heauenlie writings, then the ancient Biſhops and Doctours of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church? Who more truly tranſlated them to their greateſt paines, &amp; for the good of al ſucceeding Ages, then thoſe learnedſt Fathers? Who in ſearching the deepeſt difficulties ſo frequent in them did more ſubmit and captiuate their iudgements then theſe holy Fathers? Who euer more preſſed Hereticks with the weight of God's word then thoſe zealous Fathers? Who euer writ more large or more learned Commentaries and explanations therof, then the aged Fathers? And is it then poſſible, that the ſayd Fathers ſhould ſo directly contradict the Sacred Scriptures, as our Proteſtants pretend? But this ſo deſperate &amp; ſo vnworthie dealing againſt the Fathers, doth cleerly conuince, that Fathers were no Proteſtants, but meerly Papiſts, wherin we may glorie, as reuerencing their ſanctitie, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their learning, and honouring their Antiquitie.</p>
               <p>Neither is it true, as Proteſtants vſe to ſuggeſt, that Catholicks diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting their cauſe, if it be committed to trial by Scripture, do therefore fly from it to Fathers and Doctours; for, as for al ſuch poynts as are contayned in Scripture, to Scripture we appeale; it is that we vrge; her literal ſenſe and words hath made vs Papiſts. We therefore only recurre to Fathers, eyther for the better finding-out and vnderſtanding the true meaning of ſundrie difficult paſſages and texts of Scripture, or for the true diſcerning of ſeueral Eccleſiaſtical Traditions and doctrines taught and practiſed by the Church, and yet no where mentioned in the Writen Word. And as this is not moſt impiouſly to oppoſe Fathers to Scriptures, or to fly from Scriptures to Fathers: So is it in theſe reſpects the moſt aſſured meanes to giue vs ſatisfaction. For as none euer left more liuelie Monuments of rareſt wit &amp; profundeſt knowledge, or more ſhining teſtimonies of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt puritie and ſanctitie in life, or more aſtoniſhing wonders and miracles in confirmation of their Faith and doctrine, then theſe ancient Fathers; ſo were there none euer furniſhed with ſo good means eithers of knowing the Apoſtles, or the Apoſtles preaching, as the Apoſtles firſt heires, and next ſucceſſours, the ſweeteſt fruits of their labours, our holie Fathers.</p>

By this new league, the old one is taken away; that whoſoeuer beleeueth the Ghospel, is freed from the condition of the Law. For thoſe, who beleeue, are not vnder the Law, but vnder Grace; what need I ſay more? Chriſtians are freed from the curſe of the Law, not from the obedience.</hi> But if Chriſtians be deliuered from the condition &amp; curſe of the Law, how can they be bound to the obedience of it? Or what can the breach therof be preiudicial vnto them? So that if Catholicks do at anie time vrge againſt Proteſtants the authoritie of <hi>Moyſes</hi> or of his <hi>Law,</hi> or the Ten Commandments, ſundrie of the chiefeſt Proteſtants haue alreadie anſwered: <hi>I wil not heare Moyſes; he is Chriſt's enemie; he is the maiſter of hangmen.
